There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

  The name of the product is 'Digit Dexterity Typing Speed Challenge'.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  
  The product is for anyone who has access to a computer and would like to improve their typing speed by competing against others in typing speed contests.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  The product requires users to 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

Do you believe that you are a faster typer than your buddy? You don't know of a location on the internet where you can measure your typing speed skills against your friends? How do you rank in typing speed against other people on the internet?

These are all questions that loom in the minds of computer users.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

This product provides the opportunity for people to test their typing speed skills against their friends or people who they do not know, via a 60 second typing challenge. Both competitors will be given a prompt of words that they must type in 60 seconds. After the challenge is complete, the competitors' WPM (words-per_minute) typing speed will be calculated and the competitor with the highest WPM typing speed will be declared the victor.

This typing speed challenge is much more fun than other typing speed games out there, as during a challenge, the competitors will be able to see the progress of their opponent in real time next to their own progress, which will add a level of pressure and excitement.
